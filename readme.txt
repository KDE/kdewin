KDEWin is a supplementary library which are required for compiling 
KDE applications on Windows. 

The library provides posix related definitions and functions which are not 
available on supported windows compilers and SDK's.

history
-------

version 0.6.5
- make installing replacement functions for inet_pton and inet_ntop optional as
  they are provided in mingw32 headers version 9.0
- Add pkgconfig support
     qmake projects can use the following code fragment in a .pro file
        QT_CONFIG -= no-pkg-config
        CONFIG += link_pkgconfig
        PKGCONFIG += kdewin

     or in a less portable way
        INCLUDEPATH += `pkg-config --cflags kdewin`
        LIBS += `pkg-config --libs kdewin`
